-Variables are containers for storing data values.
-Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
-String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes

 Rules for Python variables:
--------------------------------------------
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (a and A are different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

#Legal variable names:
-----------------------------------
mybag = "John"
my_bag = "John"
_my_bag = "John"
myBag = "John"
MYBAG = "John"
mybag2 = "John"

#Illegal variable names:
-----------------------------------
2mybag = "John"
my-bag = "John"
my bag = "John"
Above 3 syntax error will occur bcz it is illegal variable names

#Multi Words Variable Names
------------------------------------------
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
Some techniques are 

1.Camel Case
--------------------
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
Eg:myVariableName = "John"
2.Pascal Case
---------------------
Each word starts with a capital letter:
Eg:MyVariableName = "John"
3.Snake Case
----------------------
Each word is separated by an underscore character:
Eg:my_variable_name = "John"

Many Values to Multiple Variables
-------------------------------------------------
assign values to multiple variables in one line:
Eg:x, y, z = "cat", "Mouse", "dog"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Note:the number of variables matches the number of values, or else you will get an error.


One Value to Multiple Variables
--------------------------------------------------
assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
Eg:
x = y = z = "goat"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Get the Type
----------------------
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Eg:
x = 5
print(type(x))

Casting
------------
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Eg:x = str(3)    # x will be '3'


#Program
--------------------
#variables
---------
x=5
X=90 #Variable names are case-sensitive.
a=1.6
b="john"
c='kite' #String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes
d=True
print(x,X,a,b,c,d)
z = float(3) Â #z will be 3.0 (casting)
print(type(z)) #get the type
n=m=1 #one value to multiple variable
print(m)
print(n)
f,i= "rose" ,"green" #many values to multiple variables
print(f)
print(i)

Output:
----------
5 90 1.6 john kite True
<class 'float'>
 1
 1 
rose 
green
