Car dealership's inventory management system

Task-1. You are tasked with creating a Python program to represent vehicles using a class. Each car should have attributes for maximum speed and mileage.

class vehicles:
    def __init__(self,max_speed,mileage):
        self.max_speed=max_speed
        self.mileage=mileage

Task-2. Update the class with the default color for all vehicles," white".

class vehicles:
    color="white"
    
    def __init__(self,max_speed,mileage):
        self.max_speed=max_speed
        self.mileage=mileage

Task-3. Additionally, you need to create methods in the Vehicle class to assign seating capacity to a vehicle.

class vehicles:
    color="white"
    
    def __init__(self,max_speed,mileage):
        self.max_speed=max_speed
        self.mileage=mileage
    def seating_capacity(self,capacity):
        self.capacity=capacity


Task-4. Create a method to display all the properties of an object of the class.

class vehicles:
    color="white"
    
    def __init__(self,max_speed,mileage):
        self.max_speed=max_speed
        self.mileage=mileage

    def seating_capacity(self,capacity):
        self.capacity=capacity

    def display_all(self):
        print("properties of the Vehicle:")
        print("Color:",self.color)
        print("Maximum Speed:", self.max_speed)
        print("Mileage:", self.mileage)
        print("Seating Capacity:", self.capacity)	
    

Task-5. Additionally, you need to create two objects of the Vehicle class object that should have a max speed of 200kph and mileage of 50000kmpl with five seating capacities, and another car object should have a max speed of 180kph and 75000kmpl with four seating capacities.

class vehicles:
    color="white"
    
    def __init__(self,max_speed,mileage):
        self.max_speed=max_speed
        self.mileage=mileage

    def seating_capacity(self,capacity):
        self.capacity=capacity

     def display_all(self):
        print("properties of the Vehicle:")
        print("Color:",self.color)
        print("Maximum Speed:", self.max_speed)
        print("Mileage:", self.mileage)
        print("Seating Capacity:", self.capacity)

# Creating objects of the Vehicle class
honda=vehicles(200,50000)
honda.seating_capacity(5)
honda.display_all()

bmw=vehicles(180,75000)
bmw.seating_capacity(4)
bmw.display_all()


output:
properties of the Vehicle:
Color: white
Maximum Speed: 200
Mileage: 50000
Seating Capacity: 5
properties of the Vehicle:
Color: white
Maximum Speed: 180
Mileage: 75000
Seating Capacity: 4
