# python
Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
-Python is a popular,high-level, open-source programming language.
-It is a powerful, fast and dynamic programming language that runs everywhere.
-It’s also interactive, object-oriented, and very easy to learn.
-Anyone can create programs with it. It’s particularly great for web development,and scientific computing. With its vast libraries, it’s also useful for data visualization
and data analytics. 
-It is interpreted language ---it doesnot need to be compile.
-It is portable-----any system that basically running c can also run python

It is used for:
-web development (server-side),
-software development,
-mathematics,
-system scripting.

What can Python do?
-used on a server to create web applications.
-software to create workflows.
-connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
-used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.

Why Python?
-works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
-simple syntax similar to the English language.
-write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.

It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
